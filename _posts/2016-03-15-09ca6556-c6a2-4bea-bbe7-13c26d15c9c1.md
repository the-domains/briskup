**What
we believe**

BriskUp is built around the idea
that regardless of any hard constraints to less tangible ones there can and should be a thriving
organism positively restless to building and moulding a
vibrant venture ecosystem --
part of which is a pronounced emphasis on attracting the
resources and developing the assets necessary to line up the needed pieces to
accelerate the success of startups.
